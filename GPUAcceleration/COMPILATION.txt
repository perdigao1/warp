Compilation notes

In order to compile the project GPUAccleration, the libraries GTOM and LIBLION must be availabel.
These are both from Tegunov

After compiling successfully GTOM And LIBLION with VisualStudio, next step is to compile this project
using them.

Important changes mush be made to project settings:
All configurations - Include Directories
	point to GTOM's and and LIBLION's include
Debug and Release configurations - set seperately Library Directories
	point to GTOM's and and LIBLION's lib folders
	Make sure the debug configuration points to the debug libs, and Release points to Release libs
	GTOM folder: /x64/<Release/Debug>
	Liblion folder: /x64/<Release/Debug> AND /fftw

Newer versions of GTOM are difficult to compile and throuw many "unresolved external symbol" errors
